# Mathematical Surfaces
 Simple Library for creating Mathematical-Surfaces 

It use the x,y,z coords of points, and return new Coords, according function.
You can Choose any Function with FunctionLibrary.cs
To create points, use Graph.cs

I made this project, with the help of lessons from CatLike Coding.
